### Easy mode (apt releases)

See our releases page for the latest CI generated deb packages for Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies. On Ubuntu, this can be done with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build rapidjson-dev
```

### Building

To build libosi, from the root of this repo run:

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
ninja -C build
```

### Installing

Installing libosi includes running:

```bash
ninja -C build package
cd build
sudo dpkg -i libosi*.deb
```

### Testing

Testing is currently implemented for offset and iohal. To run the tests, you will 
first need to install dependencies and enable testing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev

cmake -B build -GNinja -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
ninja -C build
ninja -C build test
```

### Development 

Adding support for other Windows and Linux kernels can be as simple as adding a new profile 
to `src/offset/profiles`. However, in some kernels, struct names may have changed. In these 
cases, you may need to add/port API functions in `src/osi/windows/api.cc`, where these names 
are assumed. Additionally, Linux support is for a rather old kernel version (v3.16). Supporting
a newer kernel would likely be some development work.

Support is currently limited to i386 and amd64. Support for more architectures includes writing
a new translator within `src/iohal/translators`.

Pull Requests are welcome.

### Style

Currently, the code is formatted with clang-format, using the style provided in `.clang-format`.
